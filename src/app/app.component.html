<!-- <span>{{ task.assignee.name }}</span> -->

<!-- there is a case that assignee is null (loading.... waiting for server or anything) -->
<!-- one of the solution is: -->
<!-- <span *ngIf="task.assignee">{{ task.assignee.name }}</span> -->


<!-- there is a better way, by using "Save Traversal Operator" -->
<span>{{ task.assignee?.name }}</span>
